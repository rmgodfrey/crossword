# Rossword

This is a crossword interface created using React, based on the crossword interface found in [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/crosswords). My goal for this front-end project is simply to deliver a smooth user experience, supporting keyboard and tab navigation, mouse clicks (or touch-screen presses) on crossword cells and clues, the ability to check and reveal answers, etc. In other words, all the things a user would typically take for granted.
